# FSimplex

This is a really simple an inefficient simplex solver I made for an exam. 
Mostly because I was tired of ending up with the wrong result because of some wrong fraction multiplication,
and I couldn't find a step-by-step solver that I trusted.
The only thing I will guarantee about this project is that it at the time of writing:
* Only accept the something in the standard form
* Does not detect cycles
* Does not compute the dual solution
* Does not check for unbounded solutions
* Does not simplify fractions.

Hopefully some of the things on the above list will dissappear slowly.
I do not recommend using this instead of learning simplex.
